# Euromillions prediction with neural networks

Euromillions is a lottery that takes place twice a week (on Tuesday and Friday) over all Europe, where you have to predict 5 numbers (from 1 to 50) and two stars (from 1 to 12) in order to win it. This repository contains:
- An exploratory prediction of these numbers with Deep Learning.
- [Retrieved data from the Euromillions draws]([url](https://www.euromillones.com.es/historico/euromillones-anos-anteriores.html)) from 2004 to 2023.
- The results from this prediction.

I will be updating this repository with all the advances I make on it, but the first approach will be to use RNNs considering 7 different variables (each of the five numbers plus two stars) to forecast the next draws.
